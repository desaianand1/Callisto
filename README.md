Callisto is an intelligent producitivity tool that can sync with your calendar and help you organise tasks and schedule work. This app is built from the ground up with Java, JavaFX and SQLite. Not only is Callisto lightweight and intelligent, but also portable. It is available cross-platform on macOS (Intel) and Windows.

The idea behind Callisto is to take the burden of a hectic schedule off your shoulders by organising your work, scheduling tasks, setting reminders before deadlines and saving any flashcards or notes you need to remember for the future.

## âœ¨ Features:

1. Calendar integration with your personal calendar (Apple, Gmail) or your school's calendar (Moodle, Blackboard)
2. KanBan-like task categorization.
3. Reactive Todo-list that changes task priorities based on completion/deadline using the Eisenhower matrix and related techniques.
4. Note-taking features, including flashcards. Similiar to the Anki method and optimized to follow the Dreyfus Learning Model
5. Desktop notifications when deadlines approach.
6. Statistics detailing productivity and progress made over time.
7. A gamified stochastic reward system that provides incentives to complete work on time. Numbers going up = happy chemical
